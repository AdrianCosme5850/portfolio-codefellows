      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adrian. Good Morning, My name is Adrian Cosme-Halverson. I just left the Army this last February and started looking for a long term career. I wanted to find a short-term school to improve my job prospects while I waited to go to College when I found CodeFellows. I realized that not only could this school result in a long term career, it was also something I liked to do. I love the problem solving that goes with coding. Ideally I'll find something in the defense industry that can blend my experience in the Army with this new career. The problem solving and security clearance I got in the Army will hopefully be a big help in this new career! I'm most excited about the range of possibilities in this industry. There are such a variety of problems to solve!",
